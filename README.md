# ☕ Coffee Sales Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
I developed the Coffee Sales Dashboard as a data analytics project to transform raw sales data into clear, actionable business insights. The goal was to design an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance in a simple and visually engaging way.

In this project, I:
- Collected, cleaned, and structured the sales dataset for analysis  
- Designed and built the dashboard in Power BI to enable interactive filtering by time, geography, roast type, package size, and loyalty card usage
- Conducted exploratory analysis to uncover patterns such as seasonal sales peaks, regional performance differences, and product preferences
- Communicated insights clearly to support **data-driven decision-making**
